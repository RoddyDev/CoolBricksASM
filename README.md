# Cool Bricks disassembly

A disassembly of *Cool Bricks* (Game Boy Color, 2000). It assembles to a ROM that is identical to the original (MD5 `5a7673f1e61cd707bdc880ff76396a3d`).

This is a fork of [RoddyDev/CoolBricksASM](https://github.com/RoddyDev/CoolBricksASM), which produced the matching build, the extracted graphics and the first labels in the music driver.

## Progress

![Routines named](docs/badges/routines.svg) ![Local labels](docs/badges/locals.svg) ![RAM named](docs/badges/ram.svg) ![Data labelled](docs/badges/data.svg) ![Graphics PNGs](docs/badges/graphics.svg) ![Routine comments](docs/badges/comments.svg) ![Relocation tested](docs/badges/relocation.svg) ![Play-tested](docs/badges/playtest.svg)

What each badge measures (`python tools/progress.py` recalculates them from the sources):

| Badge | Measures |
|---|---|
| Routines named | Routines (labels that start code) that have a real name, not one made from an address. |
| Local labels | `jr` targets that have a name for their purpose, not an address. |
| RAM named | Variables in `include/ram.inc` that have a real name, not `wUnk_` or `hUnk_`. |
| Data labelled | Bytes of the 1 MiB ROM that sit under a label. Bytes before the first label of a bank, and banks with no label, count as unlabelled. |
| Graphics PNGs | `.2bpp` files in `gfx/` that have a PNG. |
| Routine comments | Routines that have a header comment. |
| Relocation tested | Banks `$00`–`$13` that pass the relocation test. The number is kept by hand in `docs/progress_manual.json`. |
| Play-tested | Names and comments that were checked against behaviour in the emulator with `tools/coverage.py`. The number is kept by hand in `docs/progress_manual.json`. |

## Status

Everything in the ROM is disassembled, named and commented. The sources build the original ROM byte for byte.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Matching build | Done. `make` and `make check` both reproduce the original ROM. |
| Code and data separated | Done. |
| Routine and jump names | Done. No automatic labels are left. |
| RAM variables | Done. 382 names and no placeholders. |
| Pointer tables | Done. Every pointer is a label. |
| Level data and text | Done. |
| Music and sound driver | Done. Songs, instruments, sound effects and notes have names. |
| Language graphics banks (`$10`–`$13`) and bank 9 | Done. Animation frames, tile maps and graphics are labelled. |
| Graphics files | Done. All 45 `.2bpp` files have a PNG. |
| Routine comments | Done. All 308 routines have a header comment. |
| Relocation tests | Done. All 20 banks pass, bank 4 included. See [Checks](#checks). |
| Play-testing | Done. All 1227 names and comments were checked. A few were confirmed with RAM pokes or by reading the code. |

## Building

With [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io) 0.8.0 and GNU make:

```sh
make
```

This builds `game.gbc` and compares its MD5 with the original ROM. `Makefile.windows` is the original Windows cmd version (`make -f Makefile.windows`).

Without RGBDS, the checking assembler builds the ROM and compares its MD5:

```sh
make check
```

`tools/gbasm.py` supports only the syntax these sources use. It has no macros.

## Completed

1. **Code and data are separated.** The code was traced from the reset vector, the interrupt vectors, the game state tables and the jump tables. Everything the trace does not reach is `db`/`ds`.
   - Bank 0 is almost all code.
   - Bank 1 is part code, part tables, text and palettes.
   - Bank 6 holds the music driver (`$4000`–`$487A`) and its data.
   - Bank `$0F` holds a few interrupt handlers (`$4000`–`$4213`) and data.
   - All other banks are data.
2. **Everything in the code has a name.** Every subroutine and `jp` target has a global label. Every `jr` target is a local label named for what the code does, for example `QueueBrickHit.findFreeSlot`. The names were proposed and then checked against the code in a second pass.
3. **All RAM has names.** `include/ram.inc` names every variable the code uses, with a comment. Code in banks 0, 1, 6 and `$0F` contains no raw RAM addresses. The state values are listed there too.
4. **Pointer tables use labels.**
   - `LevelTable` (bank 5) points to `Background_*`, `LevelHeader_*`, `BrickLayout_Level*` (bank 8) and `PowerupMap_Level*` (bank `$0C`).
   - Bank 1 has `PowerupHandlers`, `PowerupSprites`, `StateInitHandlers`, `StateUpdateHandlers` and `BrickRedrawHandlers`.
   - Calls from bank 0 into banks 1, 6 and `$0F` use labels where the bank is known.
   - Bank 6 has `SongHeaders`, `SfxTable`, `PatternPointers`, `InstrumentPointers` and `NoiseInstrumentPointers`. Every pointer inside the song, instrument and sound effect data is a label too.
5. **Level data is structured.** Brick layouts and power-up maps are (count, value) pairs, one labelled block per level. Tile maps are one screen row per line and named `Tilemap_<screen>`. Graphics blocks are named `Gfx_<screen>`. `docs/ROM_MAP.md` lists what every part of each bank holds, and `python tools/rom_map.py` rebuilds it.
6. **Text is readable.** The five language tables in bank 1 (`LanguageTable_English` and so on) point to labelled strings. 106 strings and the 75 power-up messages are written as text. The credits lists in bank `$0F` are text too.
7. **The music driver is documented.** It is named, commented and described in [docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md). Songs, patterns, instruments, tables, waveforms and sound effects have labels.
8. **Graphics have PNGs.** Tile data is in `gfx/*.2bpp`, and each file has a PNG that converts back to the identical `.2bpp` file with `rgbgfx`. Some images are loaded in two parts but stored as one file.
9. **The game logic is written up.** [docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md) covers passwords, cheats, level data, power-ups, ball and enemy behaviour, screen effects and the music driver.

## Checks

The sources build to the matching ROM with RGBDS 0.8.0 (`make`) with no warnings under `rgbasm -Wall`, and with `tools/gbasm.py` (`make check`).

### Relocation

`tools/relocation_test.py` moves a bank by 3 bytes, rebuilds, and compares a scripted play-through with the original. The play-through covers the menus, the high score and credits screens that appear when the menu idles, every level load, pause, the password screens, the ending and game over. It compares the screen, not sound.

- **English.** Banks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, `$0A`, `$0C`, `$0D`, `$0E` and `$0F` pass.
- **Other languages.** Banks 0, 1, 5, `$0C` and `$0E` pass in all five languages. Banks 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, `$0A` and `$0D` pass in all five languages too. Bank `$0F` also passes in French.
- **Language graphics banks.** Banks `$0B` and `$10`–`$13` can't move by 3 bytes. They move together by 256 bytes, and each passes in its own language.
- **Sound.** `tools/sound_relocation_test.py` plays all 10 songs and all 30 sound effects. It records every write to the sound registers and the driver's variables in every frame. With bank 6 moved in two parts (3 bytes at the start, 256 bytes from `PitchSlide_00` on), the sound is identical.
- **Bank 4.** It ends with the stale filler `BankFiller_004`, which supplies the shifted bytes. It passes in all five languages.

### Play-testing

`tools/coverage.py` runs five scripted scenarios in PyBoy: levels, power-ups, weapons, enemies and menus. It counts how often each code label runs and can log RAM values at a label with `--watch`. All five scenarios together run 1113 of the 1119 labels it can hook. The other six are five vectors the game never uses (two restart vectors and three interrupt vectors) and one branch that never runs.

Reviewers checked names and comments by area against what the emulator showed, in three passes with new scenarios (`tools/playtest_*.py`, each with `--list`). They confirmed all 1227 and proposed 82 corrections, of which 75 were applied. A last pass closed the final 19 names. Most were seen in play. A few could not be reached by a player and were confirmed with a RAM poke (for example, the Triple ball nudge) or by reading the code (for example, a grenade blast on a wall cell and the unused sound effect 29).

Run it from the repository root after `make`:

```sh
python3 tools/coverage.py --list
python3 tools/coverage.py --scenario all --report
python3 tools/coverage.py --scenario powerups --watch "SpawnPowerup:wBallCount,wFallingPowerups:12"
```

PyBoy needs two workarounds, which the script applies. A hook that fires in the step that ends a frame fires again forever. Reads from `$D000`–`$DFFF` depend on the WRAM bank, so the script forces bank 1.

Each area also has a script that plays it in more detail and logs what the code does: `tools/playtest_powerups.py`, `tools/playtest_weapons.py`, `tools/playtest_enemies.py`, `tools/playtest_menus.py`, `tools/playtest_core.py` and `tools/playtest_sound.py`. The names left open after these were closed by `tools/playtest_extra0.py`, `tools/playtest_extra1.py`, `tools/playtest_extra2.py`, `tools/playtest_close0.py`, `tools/playtest_close1.py` and `tools/playtest_close2.py`. Each lists its checks with `--list`:

```sh
python3 tools/playtest_weapons.py --list
```

## Limits that can't be fixed

These come from the original ROM and can't be removed without changing it.

- **HDMA alignment.** The "HIGH SCORE" animation is sent with HDMA, which needs a source address that is a multiple of 16. The language graphics banks must keep that alignment. An `ASSERT` checks it for bank `$0B`.
- **Two sound data faults.** They tie the sound to two address bytes, so a plain shift of bank 6 isn't identical. With 3 bytes, the values written to `NR43` by the silent noise instrument change. With 256 bytes, the pitch of a few single frames of sound effect 22 changes. [docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md) explains both. The first fault reads its `NR43` values from bank 0, so moving code in bank 0 changes those silent writes too.
